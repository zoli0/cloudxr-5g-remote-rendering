## Usage

- Replace the `lucy.obj` file in `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA Corporation\CloudXR\VRDriver\CloudXRRemoteHMD\bin\win64\assets\models\` with your model of choice.
- Start `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA Corporation\CloudXR\VRDriver\CloudXRRemoteHMD\bin\win64\CloudXRServerSample.exe`.
- Connect the client to the server.

## Tested models

Models from Poly Haven should be downloaded as `.blend` files, you can export them to `.obj` files using Blender.
